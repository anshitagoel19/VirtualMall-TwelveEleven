 # Our Solution
We aim to enable Collaborative Shopping by creating a 3-D virtual environment which will give the shoppers a similar experience of shopping in a mall.
The shoppers will be able to walk walk through the sections of mall with other shoppers, enter private groups wherein they can create an exclusive environment, chat amongst themselves and create shared wish lists to choose the best clothes from the selection.  
The users will also be able to create a personalised avatar and use virtual try-on to find their best fit.
