# Problem Statement
Online shopping can be a boring experience especially when you are just sitting alone at your home and scrolling through the feed. The amazing experience of exploring the clothes/accessories together with your friends in the mall is an experience we all miss especially with COVID restricting our outside activities.

 # Our Solution
We aim to enable Collaborative Shopping by creating a 3-D virtual environment which will give the shoppers a similar experience of shopping in a mall.
The shoppers will be able to walk walk through the sections of mall with other shoppers, enter private groups wherein they can create an exclusive environment, chat amongst themselves and create shared wish lists to choose the best clothes from the selection.  
The users will also be able to create a personalised avatar and use virtual try-on to find their best fit.
